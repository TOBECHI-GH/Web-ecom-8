# GADS 2020 Community project

## OVERVIEW

This Community Project was spearheaded by TEAM "Web-ecom-8". The aim of the community project was to: 
  1. Build innovative solutions.

  2. Get an opportunity to put the skills acquired over the past 3 months into practice.

  3. Build the teams project(s) portfolio.

While challenging the team to:
  1. Implement effective and practical solutions to ensure the delivery of quality education.

  2. Strengthen the healthcare system and improve the lives of #COVID19 or non #COVID19 patients
.
  3. Develop solutions to promote e-commerce platforms and transition physical markets closer to the customers online.

  4. Build solutions that address scalable digital payments to support cashless banking, cash transfers to support payment-related activities.

  5. Ensuring the productivity of remote employees.

With the above tasks in mind, Team #web-ecom-8 got into action and had to come up with innovative ideas that would fulfill the third challenge, while meeting any other requirements.

Some processes that were taken to actualize this goal are:
  1. The team had several meetings/Ideation sessions and came up with ideas and plans to achieve this.
  
  2. While these ideas were brillant, only one had to be selected and run with at the end. At this point, questions were asked to see how vaild and actionable those ideas were. This helped to smoothen out any grey areas; and
  
  3. Finally, the best idea was selected from the lot this now took the team into the implementation, verification/testing and deployment phase.

During the Ideation phase, the team came up with an idea to create a portal that would help generate online Invoices (e-invoice) for Medium and Small Scale businesses, while hoping that this would help these businesses reduce cost on daily consumables like paper, printing ink and other associated cost invovled in the printing of traditional invoices. Hence, making the businesses more profitable at the long run. This idea birthed what we called **CUZTOMYZ.**
