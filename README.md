.
  3. Develop solutions to promote e-commerce platforms and transition physical markets closer to the customers online.

  4. Build solutions that address scalable digital payments to support cashless banking, cash transfers to support payment-related activities.

  5. Ensuring the productivity of remote employees.

With the above tasks in mind, we (Team web-ecom-8) got into action and had to come up with an innovative idea that would fulfill the third challenge, while meeting any other requirements.

Some processes that were taken to actualize our goal:
  1. We had several meetings/Ideation sessions and came up with ideas and plans to achieve this goal.
  
  2. While these ideas were brillant, we just had to pick one and run with it. At this point We asked some questions to see how vaild and actionable thoses ideas were. there by smoothing out any grey areas and
  
  3. Finally, we picked the best one from the lot and got into the implementation, verification/testing and deployment phase.

During our Ideating phase we came up with an idea to create a portal that would help generate online Invoices (e-invoice) for Medium and Small Scale businesses, while  we hope that this would help these businesses reduce cost on daily consumables like paper, printing ink and other associated cost involed in printing traditional invoices. Hence, making the businesses more profitable at the long run. This idea birthed what we called **CUZTOMYZ.**
